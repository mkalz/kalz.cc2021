abstract: "The global attention for open online education (OOE) caused a situation in which higher education institutions (HEIs) reconsider the way they deliver education to the population. With a funding policy, the Dutch Government aims to stimulate OOE in HEIs. The goal is to create more expedient, accessible and personalized learning experiences, that contribute to an improvement of quality of education and study success. However, many projects are failing to embed OOE within the institution. In this study, we elicited the challenges and opportunities of OOE projects within an organizational context of Dutch HEIs by using group concept mapping. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering resulted in a cluster map and a pattern match graph for interpreting the experts' ideas and opinions, clarifying and structuring the collective understanding. Core themes that represent the challenges and opportunities with regard to OOE identified in this study were: 1. Online teaching, 2. Supporting mechanisms, 3. Assessment, 4. External target groups, 5. Educational flexibility, 6. Quality of education, 7. Institutional reputation, and 8. Educational efficiency. The results indicated a skills gap among educators and a lack of central support for the development of OOE. Organizational efforts to implement OOE should take educational flexibility and online teaching into account and support mechanisms for OOE should be provided."
