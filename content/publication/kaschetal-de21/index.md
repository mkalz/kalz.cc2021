abstract: "Various studies advocate training students prior to a peer-feedback activity to ensure high quality of feedback. Next to investing in students’ peer-feedback skills, it is important to focus on the under- lying perceptions since perceptions influence learning behavior. We implemented an online peer-feedback training session in a massive open online course and examined students’ perceptions of peer- feedback and training focusing on their willingness, perceived use- fulness, perceived preparedness, and general attitude; and students’ peer-feedback experience and its relation to their perception. Analysis of a perception survey from 259 students revealed that the amount of prior experience results in significant differences in stu- dents’ perception. Students without prior peer-feedback experience scored higher on willingness, usefulness, preparedness, and general attitude compared to students with some prior experience. Those with a lot of experience showed the strongest positive perception scores. No significant differences for the effect of training on percep- tion could be measured with the available data."
